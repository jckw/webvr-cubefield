# ðŸ•¹ WebVR Cubefield

A clone of Cubefield, a primary school classic, with some WebVR capabilities added. 

## How to play
Either use a WebVR compatible headset, and tilt you head to move through the field, or use the left and right arrow keys.

## Set up
Parcel is used to package the application, and quickly spin up a development server.

First, install the dependencies with Yarn:

```
$ yarn
```

Then start the dev server:

```
$ parcel index.html
```
